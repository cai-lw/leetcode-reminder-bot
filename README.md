# Leetcode Reminder Bot

Remind you if you haven't solved any Leetcode problem for too long.

## Features

**Send an email to you every day** if you haven't solved any Leetcode problem for **at least 24 hours at the time the email is sent**.

This project is still in an early stage. We may add customizable reminder frequency and conditions, or other forms of notification in the future.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue and discuss.

## Subscribe

Currently, the list of users is maintained manually, but we may implement automatic subscription and unsubscription in the future.

Send email to [cai.lw123@gmail.com](mailto:cai.lw123@gmail.com) if you want to subscribe or unsubscribe. Please provide your Leetcode user name in the email. (Your profile page is `https://leetcode.com/<your_name>/`, and you should provide the `<your_name>` part)
